# SDL2 frame buffer manipulation test: Star field

A fixed version of the article from https://dev.to/shindakun/going-to-the-stars-with-sdl2-and-go-53ff . The code was kinda outdated and not working anymore.

This adds a few tweaks (can increase/decrease the star speed by using up/down arrow keys).

## Requirements
Needs [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) wrapper.

## Run it
```
go run main.go
```
